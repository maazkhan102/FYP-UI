        <h1>Features of FitTrack</h1>
        <h3>1) Movement Tracking</h3>
        <p>This system of ours will track every movement of the human body. A lot of people want to track themselves throughout the day if they are sitting in the wrong posture or if they are sitting in a seat for hours which is surely not appropriate for the human body and health. Also, to check if they are working or doing things as fast as they should be done.</p>
    <h3>2) Selection of Exercise by hand gestures</h3>
    <p>The user will be able to select the exercise of his choice by doing a hand gesture.</p>
<h3>3) Exercise Repetition Tracking</h3>
<p>This monitoring system will keep a count of repetition of each exercise a human is doing in front of the camera.</p>

<h1>FitTrack Perspective</h1>
<p>Fit Track will be the first ever exercise tracking system which has the potential to grab people’s
    attention. There can be multiple use cases of these type of models. We’ll be using PoseNet Algorithm
    to detect the human posture. PoseNet is a real-time pose detection technique with which you can
    detect human beings poses in Image or Video. It works in both cases as single-mode (single human pose
    detection) and multi-pose detection(Multiple humans pose detection). In simple words, Posenet is a
    deep learning TensorFlow model that allows you to estimate human pose by detecting body parts such
    as elbows, hips, wrists, knees, ankles, and form a skeleton structure of your pose by joining these points.
    PoseNet is trained in MobileNet Architecture. MobileNet is a Convolutional neural network developed
    by google which is trained on the ImageNet dataset, majorly used for Image classification in categories
    and target estimation. It is a lightweight model which uses depthwise separable convolution to deepen
    the network and reduce parameters, computation cost, and increased accuracy.</p>
