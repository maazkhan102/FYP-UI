    <h1>Purpose & Goals of FitTrack</h1>
    <P>In this fast-moving world, people don’t take care of their fitness and health these days. In recent
        research, it is being delivered that over 95% of people of the world’s population have health-related
        problems. To tackle this problem every individual should exercise at least three times a week. As we
        know that doing exercise is not a piece of cake for most of us as we don’t know the correct posture for
        each exercise. You must have to hire a gym instructor or fitness coach because doing the wrong posture
        of the exercises or doing excessive training can harm our physical health, serious injury can occur as
        well. Some people don’t have resources and some don’t have time to go to the gym. So here comes “Fit
        Track”. Fit Track can be your workout buddy, fitness trainer, and workout guide.</P>
        <p>The real-life and real-time human movement detection of their activity identification is very challenging.
            Since the real-life activities of humans could be of much interest in almost all areas, the subject of
            identifying human activities has become the most popular research field. Identifying human movements
            in public places like airports, railway stations, hospitals, and homes for the aged becomes very essential
            due to the several benefits incurred from the human movement recognition system such as surveillance
            cameras, monitoring devices, etc. Nowadays as t of threats are employed leaving their children or the
            elderly in the hands of the babysitter or caretakers. The major aspect of this system would be exercise.
            Regular exercise is one of the most important factors in maintaining a good state of health. In the past,
            different systems have been proposed to assist people when exercising. While most of those systems
            focus only on cardio exercises such as running and cycling, we exploit this system to support different
            activities with a focus on resistance training.
            There will be a system where movements of the human body are monitored and stored using Deep
            learning. Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning. It is a type of machine learning based on
            
            artificial neural networks in which multiple layers of processing are used to extract progressively higher-
            level features from data</p>
            <h3>Fit Track can be a workout buddy, fitness trainer, and workout guide. Fit Track is a real-time movement
                detection system that will detect a person who is exercising in front of the camera. Fit Track will guide
                the person if he/she is doing the exercise with the correct posture and angle. If the posture will be
                correct, then the fit track will start to count the repetition of each exercise a person is doing. For each
                exercise, repetition will be counted, and by the end of every set, the fit track will calculate the calories
                burned in each set in a session. This model can sort a lot of things. Fit Track can also help those Athletes
                who want to track every movement and calorie burn in their body</h3>
